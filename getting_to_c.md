# Getting to C
This chapter will show you how to use C instead of assembly code as the programming
language for the OS. Assembly is very good for interacting with the CPU and
enables maximum control over every aspect of the code.  However, at least for
the authors, C is a much more convenient language to use. Therefore, we would
like to use C as much as possible and use assembly code only where it make sense.

## Setting Up a Stack
One prerequisite for using C is a stack, since all non-trivial C programs use
a stack.  Setting up a stack is not harder than to make the `esp` register
point to the end of an area of free memory (remember that the stack grows
towards lower addresses on the x86) that is correctly aligned (alignment on 4 bytes is
recommended from a performance perspective).

We could point `esp` to a random area in memory since, so far, the only thing
in the memory is GRUB, BIOS, the OS kernel and some memory-mapped I/O.  This is
not a good idea - we don't know how much memory is available or if the
area `esp` would point to is used by something else. A better idea is to
reserve a piece of uninitialized memory in the `bss` section in the ELF file
of the kernel. It is better to use the `bss` section instead of the
`data` section to reduce the size of the OS executable. Since GRUB understands
ELF, GRUB will allocate any memory reserved in the `bss` section
when loading the OS.

The NASM pseudo-instruction `resb` [@resb] can be used to declare uninitialized
data:

~~~ {.nasm}
    KERNEL_STACK_SIZE equ 4096                  ; size of stack in bytes

    section .bss
    align 4                                     ; align at 4 bytes
    kernel_stack:                               ; label points to beginning of memory
        resb KERNEL_STACK_SIZE                  ; reserve stack for the kernel
~~~

There is no need to worry about the use of uninitialized memory for the stack,
since it is not possible to read a stack location that has not been written
(without manual pointer fiddling).
A (correct) program can not pop an element from the stack
without having pushed an element onto the stack first. Therefore, the memory
locations of the stack will always be written to before they are being read.

The stack pointer is then set up by pointing `esp` to the end of the
`kernel_stack` memory:

~~~ {.nasm}
    mov esp, kernel_stack + KERNEL_STACK_SIZE   ; point esp to the start of the
                                                ; stack (end of memory area)
~~~

## Calling C Code From Assembly
The next step is to call a C function from assembly code. There are many
different conventions for how to call C code from assembly code
[@wiki:ccall]. This book uses the _cdecl_ calling convention, since that is the
one used by GCC. The cdecl calling convention states that arguments to a
function should be passed via the stack (on x86). The arguments of the function
should be pushed on the stack in a right-to-left order, that is, you push the
rightmost argument first. The return value of the function is placed in the
`eax` register. The following code shows an example:

~~~ {.c}
    /* The C function */
    int sum_of_three(int arg1, int arg2, int arg3)
    {
        return arg1 + arg2 + arg3;
    }
~~~

~~~ {.nasm}
    ; The assembly code
    extern sum_of_three   ; the function sum_of_three is defined elsewhere

    push dword 3            ; arg3
    push dword 2            ; arg2
    push dword 1            ; arg1
    call sum_of_three       ; call the function, the result will be in eax
~~~

### Packing Structs
In the rest of this book, you will often come across "configuration bytes" that are
a collection of bits in a very specific order. Below follows an example with 32
bits:

    Bit:     | 31     24 | 23          8 | 7     0 |
    Content: | index     | address       | config  |

Instead of using an unsigned integer, `unsigned int`, for handling such
configurations, it is much more convenient to use "packed structures":

~~~ {.C}
    struct example {
        unsigned char config;   /* bit 0 - 7   */
        unsigned short address; /* bit 8 - 23  */
        unsigned char index;    /* bit 24 - 31 */
    };
~~~

When using the `struct` in the previous example there is no guarantee that the
size of the `struct` will be exactly 32 bits - the compiler can add some
padding between elements for various reasons, for example to speed up element
access or due to requirements set by the hardware and/or compiler. When using a
`struct` to represent configuration bytes, it is very important that the
compiler does _not_ add any padding, because the `struct` will eventually be
treated as a 32 bit unsigned integer by the hardware. The attribute `packed`
can be used to force GCC to _not_ add any padding:

~~~ {.C}
    struct example {
        unsigned char config;   /* bit 0 - 7   */
        unsigned short address; /* bit 8 - 23  */
        unsigned char index;    /* bit 24 - 31 */
    } __attribute__((packed));
~~~

Note that `__attribute__((packed))` is not part of the C standard - it might
not work with all C compilers.

## Compiling C Code
When compiling the C code for the OS, a lot of flags to GCC need to be used.
This is because the C code should _not_ assume the presence of a standard
library, since there is no standard library available for our OS. For more
information about the flags, see the GCC manual.

The flags used for compiling the C code are:

~~~
    -m32 -ffreestanding -fbuiltin -fno-stack-protector
~~~

As always when writing C programs we recommend turning on all warnings and
treat warnings as errors:

~~~
    -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror
~~~

You can now create a function `kmain` in a file called `kmain.c` that you call
from `loader.s`. At this point, `kmain` probably won't need any arguments (but
in later chapters it will).

## Build Tools
Now is also probably a good time to set up some build tools to make it easier
to compile and test-run the OS. We recommend using `make` [@make], but there are
plenty of other build systems available. A simple Makefile for the OS could
look like the following example:

~~~ {.Makefile}
    OBJECTS = loader.o kmain.o
    CC = gcc
    CFLAGS = -m32 -ffreestanding -fbuiltin -fno-stack-protector \
             -Wall -Wpedantic -Wextra -Werror -O2 -c
    LDFLAGS = -T link.ld -melf_i386 -nostdlib
    AS = nasm
    ASFLAGS = -f elf

    all: kernel.elf

    kernel.elf: $(OBJECTS)
        ld $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) -o kernel.elf

    os.iso: kernel.elf
        cp kernel.elf iso/boot/kernel.elf
        genisoimage -R                              \
                    -b boot/grub/stage2_eltorito    \
                    -no-emul-boot                   \
                    -boot-load-size 4               \
                    -A os                           \
                    -input-charset utf8             \
                    -quiet                          \
                    -boot-info-table                \
                    -o os.iso                       \
                    iso

    run: os.iso
        bochs -f bochsrc.txt -q

    %.o: %.c
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS)  $< -o $@

    %.o: %.s
        $(AS) $(ASFLAGS) $< -o $@

    clean:
        rm -rf *.o kernel.elf os.iso
~~~

The contents of your working directory should now look like the following
figure:

~~~
    .
    |-- bochsrc.txt
    |-- iso
    |   |-- boot
    |     |-- grub
    |       |-- menu.lst
    |       |-- stage2_eltorito
    |-- kmain.c
    |-- loader.s
    |-- Makefile
~~~

You should now be able to start the OS with the simple command `make
run`, which will compile the kernel and boot it up in Bochs (as defined in the
Makefile above).
