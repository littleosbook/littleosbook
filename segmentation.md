# Segmentation

_Segmentation_ in x86 means accessing the memory through segments. Segments are
portions of the address space, possibly overlapping, specified by a base
address and a limit. To address a byte in segmented memory you use a 48-bit
_logical address_: 16 bits that specifies the segment and 32-bits that
specifies what offset within that segment you want. The offset is added to the
base address of the segment, and the resulting linear address is checked
against the segment's limit - see the figure below. If everything works out
fine (including access-rights checks ignored for now) the result is a _linear
address_. When paging is disabled, then
the linear address space is mapped 1:1 onto the _physical address_ space, and
the physical memory can be accessed. (See the chapter ["Paging"](#paging) for
how to enable paging.)

To enable segmentation you need to set up a table that describes each segment -
a _segment descriptor table_. In x86, there are two types of descriptor tables:
the _Global Descriptor Table_ (GDT) and _Local Descriptor Tables_ (LDT). An LDT
is set up and managed by user-space processes, and all processes have their own
LDT.  LDTs can be used if a more complex segmentation model is desired - we
won't use it. The GDT is shared by everyone - it's global.

As we discuss in the sections on virtual memory and paging, segmentation is
rarely used more than in a minimal setup, similar to what we do below.

## Accessing Memory
Most of the time when accessing memory there is no need to explicitly specify
the segment to use. The processor has six 16-bit segment registers: `cs`, `ss`,
`ds`, `es`, `gs` and  `fs`. The register `cs` is the code segment register and
specifies the segment to use when fetching instructions. The register `ss` is
used whenever accessing the stack (through the stack pointer `esp`), and `ds`
is used for other data accesses. The OS is free to use the registers `es`, `gs`
and `fs` however it wants.

Below is an example showing implicit use of the segment registers:

~~~ {.nasm}
    func:
        mov eax, [esp+4]
        mov ebx, [eax]
        add ebx, 8
        mov [eax], ebx
        ret
~~~

The above example can be compared with the following one that makes explicit
use of the segment registers:

~~~ {.nasm}
    func:
        mov eax, [ss:esp+4]
        mov ebx, [ds:eax]
        add ebx, 8
        mov [ds:eax], ebx
        ret
~~~

You don't need to use `ss` for storing the stack segment selector, or `ds` for
the data segment selector. You could store the stack segment selector in `ds`
and vice versa. However, in order to use the implicit style shown above, you
must store the segment selectors in their indented registers.

Segment descriptors and their fields are described in figure 3-8 in the Intel
manual [@intel3a].

## The Global Descriptor Table (GDT)

A GDT/LDT is an array of 8-byte segment descriptors. The first descriptor in
the GDT is always a null descriptor and can never be used to access memory. At
least two segment descriptors (plus the null descriptor) are needed for the GDT,
because the descriptor contains more information than just the base and
limit fields. The two most relevant fields for us are the _Type_ field and the
_Descriptor Privilege Level_ (DPL) field.

Table 3-1 in chapter 3 of the Intel manual [@intel3a] specifies the values for
the Type field. The table shows that the Type field can't be both
writable _and_ executable at the same time.
Therefore, two segments are needed: one segment for executing code to put in
`cs` (Type is Execute-only or Execute-Read) and one segment for reading and
writing data (Type is Read/Write) to put in the other segment registers.

The DPL specifies the _privilege levels_ required to use the segment. x86
allows for four privilege levels (PL), 0 to 3, where PL0 is the most
privileged. In most operating systems (eg. Linux and Windows), only PL0 and PL3
are used. However, some operating system, such as MINIX, make use of all
levels. The kernel should be able to do anything, therefore it uses segments
with DPL set to 0 (also called kernel mode). The current privilege level (CPL)
is determined by the segment selector in `cs`.

The segments needed are described in the table below.

  Index   Offset   Name                 Address range             Type   DPL
-------  -------   -------------------  ------------------------- -----  ----
      0   `0x00`   null descriptor
      1   `0x08`   kernel code segment  `0x00000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF` RX     PL0
      2   `0x10`   kernel data segment  `0x00000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF` RW     PL0

Table: The segment descriptors needed.

Note that the segments overlap - they both encompass the entire linear address
space. In our minimal setup we'll only use segmentation to get privilege levels.
See the Intel manual [@intel3a], chapter 3, for details on the other descriptor
fields.

## Loading the GDT

Loading the GDT into the processor is done with the `lgdt` assembly code
instruction, which takes the address of a struct that specifies the start and
size of the GDT.  It is easiest to encode this information using a ["packed
struct"](#packing-structs) as shown in the following example:

~~~ {.c}
    struct gdt {
        unsigned int address;
        unsigned short size;
    } __attribute__((packed));
~~~

If the content of the `eax` register is the address to such a struct, then the
GDT can be loaded with the assembly code shown below:

~~~ {.nasm}
    lgdt [eax]
~~~

It might be easier if you make this instruction available from C, the same way
as was done with the assembly code instructions `in` and `out`.

After the GDT has been loaded the segment registers needs to be loaded with
their corresponding segment selectors. The content of a segment selector is
described in the figure and table below:

    Bit:     | 15                                3 | 2  | 1 0 |
    Content: | offset (index)                      | ti | rpl |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name             Description
---------------- -------------------------------------------------------
rpl              Requested Privilege Level - we want to execute in PL0
                 for now.

ti               Table Indicator. 0 means that this specifies a GDT segment, 1
                 means an LDT Segment.

offset (index)   Offset within descriptor table.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table: The layout of segment selectors.

The offset of the segment selector is added to the start of the GDT to get the
address of the segment descriptor: `0x08` for the first descriptor and `0x10`
for the second, since each descriptor is 8 bytes. The Requested Privilege Level
(RPL) should be `0` since the kernel of the OS should execute in privilege
level 0.

Loading the segment selector registers is easy for the data registers - just
copy the correct offsets to the registers:

~~~ {.nasm}
    mov ds, 0x10
    mov ss, 0x10
    mov es, 0x10
    .
    .
    .
~~~

To load `cs` we have to do a "far jump":

~~~ {.nasm}
    ; code here uses the previous cs
    jmp 0x08:flush_cs   ; specify cs when jumping to flush_cs

    flush_cs:
        ; now we've changed cs to 0x08
~~~

A far jump is a jump where we explicitly specify the full 48-bit logical
address: the segment selector to use and the absolute address to jump to. It
will first set `cs` to `0x08` and then jump to `flush_cs` using its absolute
address.
